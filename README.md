# Snake Game

Snake game made with c++ and SFML library

## Why?

- By making this project **I've practiced a lot of programming** specially because it's done using C++
- By using SFML IÂ¿ve practice graphics/game programming with a pretty cool and fast language such as C++

## What new I learned

- Handling header files
- Handling Makefile for compilation and execution
- namespaces
- constexpr variables
- inline variables
- database (accessing files)

## What I learned but didn't apply
- coroutines
- SQL local connection
- Graphics programming
